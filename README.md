# [NestJS Task Management](http://nestjs-task-management-frontend-h70.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)
A full-stack project created to allow users to manage their tasks by creating their own accounts and storing their tasks and task statuses.

Check out the live app [here](http://nestjs-task-management-frontend-h70.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)!

## Motivation
I created this site because I wanted to learn how to build a fullstack web application using a JavaScript front and backend. I decided that I wanted to learn NestJS to dive deeper into building scalable and secure server-side applications. I referenced Ariel Weinberger's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero/) to help me along the way. The app authorizes users to sign-in to a task management dashboard, where they can add and remove tasks, update task status and search/filter tasks.
